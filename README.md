# deb-models-experiments

These are experiments in packaging CSDMS models
for Debian-based Linux distros.

In particular,
I'm using [Alien](https://joeyh.name/code/alien/)
to convert the **.rpm** packages from
[csdms/rpm_tools](https://github.com/csdms/rpm_tools)
and [csdms/rpm_models](https://github.com/csdms/rpm_models)
into **.deb** packages,
and I want to see how they behave
in the Travis CI
Ubuntu 12.04 build environment.
